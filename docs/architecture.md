# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the application architecture, design patterns, and component relationships.

## Architectural Patterns

The application follows these architectural patterns:

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear boundaries between layers.
2. **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction of data access logic.
3. **Dependency Injection**: Inversion of control for better testability.
4. **Service Pattern**: Encapsulation of business logic in service classes.

## Layer Structure

### Presentation Layer
- **Routes**: API endpoints that handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Pydantic Schemas**: Data validation and serialization

### Application Layer
- **Services**: Business logic and orchestration
- **Helpers**: Utility functions for specific domains

### Data Access Layer
- **Database Queries**: SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation
- **Database Utilities**: Connection pooling, session management

### Infrastructure Layer
- **External Services**: Integration with third-party services
- **Utilities**: Logging, configuration, etc.

## Component Relationships

```
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
|    Routes      |---->|    Services    |---->|  DB Queries    |
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
        |                     |                      |
        v                     v                      v
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
|Pydantic Schemas|     |    Helpers     |     |Database Utility|
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
                              |
                              v
                       +----------------+
                       |External Services|
                       +----------------+
```

## Flow of Control

1. HTTP request is received by a route handler
2. Route handler validates request data using Pydantic schemas
3. Route handler calls service methods to process the request
4. Service methods use helpers and database queries to perform operations
5. Database queries interact with the database
6. Results flow back up the chain and are serialized into a response

## Error Handling

Errors are handled at appropriate layers:

1. **Validation Errors**: Handled by Pydantic at the schema level
2. **Business Logic Errors**: Handled by services
3. **Database Errors**: Handled by database query functions
4. **HTTP Errors**: Handled by route handlers

## Asynchronous Design

The application uses async/await throughout the stack:

1. **Async Route Handlers**: Handle requests concurrently
2. **Async Database Operations**: Non-blocking database access
3. **Async HTTP Client**: Non-blocking external service calls

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **API Tests**: Test HTTP endpoints end-to-end

## Configuration Management

Configuration is loaded from environment variables and .env files using Pydantic settings management.

## Deployment Architecture

The application is designed to be deployed as a Docker container in a cloud environment with a PostgreSQL database.
