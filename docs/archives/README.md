# CLAUDE.md Archives

This directory contains archived content from the main CLAUDE.md file. Archives are created to keep the main file focused and manageable while preserving historical context.

## Archive Naming Convention

Archives follow this naming pattern:
```
CLAUDE_ARCHIVE_YYYY_MM.md
```

For example:
- `CLAUDE_ARCHIVE_2024_06.md` - Content archived in June 2024

## What Gets Archived

- Completed tasks older than 2 weeks
- Change history older than 1 month
- Architectural decisions that are no longer actively relevant
- Deprecated approaches or patterns

## Archive Structure

Each archive file should maintain the original section structure from CLAUDE.md, but only include the sections that contain archived content.

## How to Use Archives

When working on the project, you may need to refer to archives for:

1. Understanding historical decisions
2. Reviewing past approaches to similar problems
3. Checking when and why certain features were implemented

If you need to reference archived information frequently, consider adding a summary to the main CLAUDE.md file with a link to the relevant archive.
